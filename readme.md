## I keep repressing how much I dislike ASP.NET
Despite there being documentation on Microsoft's website that basically
does this assignment for you, it still took me 4 hours of constant
debugging to figure out why it didn't work.

I never figured out why, as it solved itself once it decided that
I'd aged enough.

I hope this is okay, there's not a whole lot of my own code-on account of it all being in the documentation already ̣-in here but I can explain most of it. 

I did make a wholehearted attempt at making my own api from scratch (it was also a TodoApi)
but with ASP.NET it really only ends in a frustrating disaster. The documentation surrounding
it is very much more <How to> do something, not <Why> that something works.

## I think this assignment in particular could use some work:
I think this is generally really valuable for us to know. How to make our own API, and communicate
with it. It's not something we will be able to escape as web developers, and getting comfy with it 
will only serve us well.

I do however thing that this course should be longer for this purpose, learning this. OR more focused.
As it stands, it's a lot to take in how to work with ASP.NET already, it's not a framework that is 
easily understood, and has a tendency to throw hissy fits if the air near the PC smells too much
of raspberry as opposed to banana.

My point is, I think this assignment is a little bit too far out of our classes scope due to a 
multitude of reasons. Most of all that ASP.NET is a very complicated and fussy beast.
